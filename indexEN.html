        <p class="content"><strong style="color: #F4D707; margin-right: 20px;">Web Development</strong>  Is the art to be able to create whatever you want with the appropriate tools. It is the work involved in developing a website for the Internet (World Wide Web) or an intranet (a private network)
            Web development can range from developing a simple single static page of plain text to complex web applications,
            electronic businesses, and social network services. A more comprehensive list of tasks to which Web development commonly refers, 
            may include Web engineering, Web design, Web content development, client liaison, client-side/server-side scripting, 
            Web server and network security configuration, and e-commerce development.
